This needs to be run on a machine with Terraform install and the
Azure CLI.  Personal login for the Azure CLI can be done with:

	az login

The actual account used is a service principal account though:

	az ad sp create-for-rbac -n kernelci-k8s

which outputs an appId and password, this should be distributed via the
credential store and set in terraform variables, see variables.tf.

When the clusters are created a logged in user can set up the client
credentials like this:

	for c in $(az aks list --query '[].name' -o tsv) ; do
		az aks get-credentials --resource-group kernelci-workers --name ${c}
	done

(TBD: also put this in outputs.tf, need to figure out syntax for arrays)
